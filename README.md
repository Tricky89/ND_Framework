 To Start First Download ND_Framework, you can edit the config Files now or wait.
  Next we will head over to https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql And download the Latest release from the releases tab that can be found on the right of your         screen.
  Next we can put that in our resources folder and add "ensure oxmysql" Right under "ensure hardcap", It doesn't *HAVE* To be here per say but it is *Crucial* That it    is started before the framework or anything that uses it!
  After this we can move on to our Sql connection String.
  Your SQL string should be formatted one of two ways depending on how you are hosting:
  set mysql_connection_string "mysql://user:password@host/database?charset=utf8mb4"
  or
  set mysql_connection_string "mysql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{database}?charset=utf8mb4" 
  *Side Note* If you are using a Host that uses Pterodactyl you *CANNOT* Have a "=" in your password!
  Once you have the info for your SQL string simply putting your information in place of the placeholders!
  Next we can throw the Framework in our Resources folder and if we haven't already Change the config files to our likings! Make sure to Ensure all parts of the framework!
